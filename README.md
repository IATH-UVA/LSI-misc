# LSI-misc -very old scripts and dirty data
Various data parsing scripts for the landscape studies initiative
Really nothing useful nor important, just getting everything into uva hands

1. imageDictionary.js
	* this is to run through the 6500 image list (excel/csv) and catalog case-sites into json format (evolving, not to be added on form at bottom of readme) so that RA additions can be more focused on method and integrating new material
2. ocrTest.js
	* working with the already posted pdf's of BBR's text... just to catalog/rank terms and start thinking about search mechanisms/uses and term hierarchies/cluster for themes... proof of concept stuff
3. folder of metadata schemes / control vocabulary structures
	* running list of control vocabs and their source for whittling down materials into do-able cataloging exercise
4. always more to come. . .
